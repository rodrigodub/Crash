This projects started as an implementation of [CrashCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse) Physics concepts, but then it evolved a bit. It currently have two development streams:

## Physics
What started as just [CrashCourse Physics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN0ge7yDk_UA0ldZJdhwkoV) is now much expanded with the implementation of two Physics textbooks: Tipler & Mosca's [Physics for Scientists and Engineers](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Scientists-Engineers-Vol-Thermodynamics/dp/1429201320/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1494837891&sr=8-2&keywords=tipler+mosca), and Halliday & Resnick's [Fundamentals of Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Physics-Extended-David-Halliday/dp/0470469080/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1494838063&sr=8-3&keywords=halliday+resnick).

## Computer Science
This is still just [CrashCourse Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo).
